All rights reserved.===========================================================================Summary:	This folder contains the classes which are used to implement	undo and redo for the Constructor data model.Theory of operation:	Complex actions are broken into miniature actions (called "sub	actions") that can be easily described. Only three sub actions are	needed to describe all the changes ever made by users: value change	(change property), list change (insertion & deletion), and modified	flag change. Modified flag change is really a special case of value	change that is needed because the modified flag is not stored as a	first-class attribute.	When the user interface begins to process a user request to change	the data model, it creates an StDMTransactionBuilder on the stack.	This object gathers all the sub actions that make up this user	request. If an exception is thrown or Abort() is called, the sub	actions are asked to undo themselves and the data model is restored	to its original state. If Commit() is called, the list of sub	actions is packaged into a DMTransaction (subclass of PowerPlant's	LAction) which then redoes or undoes the entire set of sub actions	as a group.Components:    * DMTransaction - Complete undoable action    * DMSubAction - Abstract base class for sub actions    * DMAttributeSubAction - Sub action to change an attribute value    * DMListSubAction - Sub action to insert or remove an item from a list    * DMModFlagSubAction - Sub action to change a modified flag    * StDMAttributeSetter - Helper for setting values on DMAttribute objects    * StDMTransactionBuilder - Helper for creating DMTransaction objects    * StDMTransactionHider - Use when data model changes should    		not be reflected in undo/redoResource IDs:	The IDs 22800 - 22899 are assigned to the Undo-redo folder.===========================================================================	* History=========================================================================== Created: 04/28/96   $Date: 2006/01/18 03:40:25 $$History: 00- Undo-redo.README $*****************  Version 5  *****************User: scouten      QDate: 02/20/97   Time: 14:49Updated in $/Constructor/Source files/CO- Core/Data model/Undo-redoImproved commenting.
