It contains a	lightweight mechanism for implementing undo/redo.Components:    * Core objects - Storage for basic objects and selection implementation    * Attributes - Storage objects for object properties    * Exceptions - Exception classes used to signal invalid property entries    * Undo-redo - Implementation of undo/redo for data model    * Utilities - Helper classes for implementing user interface    		based on the data modelResource IDs:	The IDs 22000Ê- 22999 are assigned to the Data model folder.		 22500 - 22699: Attributes		 22700 - 22799:	Utilities		 22800 - 22899:	Undo-redo		 22900 - 22999:	Exceptions===========================================================================	* History=========================================================================== Created: 04/28/96   $Date: 2006/01/18 03:39:47 $$History: 00- Data model.README $*****************  Version 6  *****************User: scouten      QDate: 02/20/97   Time: 13:26Updated in $/Constructor/Source files/CO- Core/Data modelImproved commenting.*****************  Version 5   *****************User: scouten      Date: 01/24/97   Time: 17:19Checked in '$/Constructor/Source files/CO- Core/Data model'Comment: Fixed CR/LF problem*****************  Version 4   *****************User: scouten      Date: 11/04/96   Time: 13:57Checked in '$/Constructor/Source files/Data model'Comment: Added resource ID block for Exceptions folder.*****************  Version 3   *****************User: scouten      Date: 11/02/96   Time: 16:36Checked in '$/Constructor/Source files/Data model'Comment: Added resource ID allocation for Undo-redo folder.*****************  Version 2   *****************User: scouten      Date: 10/31/96   Time: 17:50Checked in '$/Constructor/Source files/Data model'Comment: Added resource ID block for attributes.*****************  Version 1   *****************User: scouten      Date: 10/16/96   Time: 01:29CreatedComment: Baseline source 15 October 1996.
