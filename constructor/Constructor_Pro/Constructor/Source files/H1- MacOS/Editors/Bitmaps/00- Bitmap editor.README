Plus we animate during the selection.In 1x mode (ie, large images)	It is easier to click on the bottom & right pixels	Select All marquee doesn't get clipped on bottom & right	Improved accuracy of mouse clicks a bit  	More accurate mouse clicks in a few placesDon't revert to the default color table quite so often when  switching between different icon sizes. We keep track of  the color table based on the image depth, so all n-bit  resource types (icl8, ics8, etc) within a window display   the same table. The initial click when using the text tool is now the baseline  of the first row rather than its vertical center. This makes  it easier to put the text exactly where you want it.------------------------------------------------Bitmap editor release notes for CW11 Constructor------------------------------------------------Features added:---------------Text tool now implemented.   Bugs fixed:-----------Black pixels sometimes mapped to a wrong color when the window was closed. Resizing an image then immediately closing the window caused problems for  some people.The rectangular selection tool works better, especially from right-to-left and bottom-to-top selections. Changing the id of a resource and then editing it sometimes reverted to the wrong resource or gave errors. It was possible to paste an image that would appear completely outside the window.
